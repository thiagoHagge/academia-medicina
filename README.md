# Medicine Blog and Admin Panel

This project focuses on developing the layout for a blog and an admin panel using Next.js, CSS libraries such as Material-UI and Bootstrap. The backend of the project is implemented separately and can be found in another repository at [https://github.com/thiagoHagge/blog-api](https://github.com/thiagoHagge/blog-api).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly blog design along with an intuitive admin panel. The frontend is built using Next.js, a popular React framework that provides server-side rendering, routing, and other useful features out of the box. Additionally, CSS libraries like Material-UI and Bootstrap are used to enhance the design and provide pre-styled components.

The admin panel includes the functionality for creating news articles. To achieve this, the CKEditor library was integrated into the admin interface. CKEditor is a popular rich text editor that enables users to create and edit content with formatting options, including text styles, lists, images, and more.

The project's backend is implemented separately in the [blog-api](https://github.com/thiagoHagge/blog-api) repository. This backend repository contains the necessary logic to handle blog posts, user authentication, and other related functionalities. The frontend interacts with the backend through API calls to retrieve and manipulate data.
